1. Which method(s) do you need to implement from this interface (Comparable)?
Method, which is needed to implement, is compareTo().

2. What happens and explain it in detail? (Question in section 6)
Even though the objects is upcasted to Media, the print still shows that the implementation of toString() 
is different across the objects. In particular, they call the implementations based on the types of objects
(e.g. CD calls it own implementation for toString(), not the general toString() in Media).
