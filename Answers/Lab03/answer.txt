1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by 
category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: When I do that, Java will display a light bulb with a cross on the bottom left, saying that the method
(constructor) is duplicated. This means Java marks it as an error and will prevent the run of program later. 
Things could be different a bit when I try to test these constructors through Aims.java. It actually returned a 
window notifying me that there were errors in project(s) AimsProject but still gave an option to proceed the launch.
And when the run was proceed, the observation derived was interesting since the attribute title is filled and
category was set as null. (the constructor of title is put over the constructor of category)

2. Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. 
Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

Answer: In this case, I guess that the question try to mention "varargs" vs array. As far as I know, they are quite
the same since java is actually making an array of arguments and passing it when var args is used. But varargs is 
kind of implicit and array is more explicit on the other hand. It can be unexpected consequences, used wrong. 
They can strip away some of the type safety I may have had with the original array argument. For example, a 2D array
could be a trouble to varargs.
